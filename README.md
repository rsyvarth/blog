# Introduction
Tsu :snowflake: is cloud native, open source blogging software designed with extensibility and back-end developer experience in mind.

## Tenets
- Put learning first.
  Our goal is come away with software we can both use as a learning tool to explore cloud native architectures and for its intended purpose (as blogging software).  
- Leverage cloud native architectures and tools.
- Prioritize back-end developer experience.
- Be opinionated in initial design choices while leaving space for maximum configurability and flexibility.

## Features
- Minimal UI, emphasis on back-end.
- Production ready and thoroughly documented.
- Platform and tool agnostic in final state..
